                    <p>
                        Welcome to HTML! Every webpage you've ever opened‚ÄîGoogle, YouTube, your friend's cursed portfolio‚Äîstarts with HTML.
                        Think of HTML as the skeleton of the web. It tells the browser what things are, not how they look.
                    </p>

                    <p>Let's build your very first page together.</p>

                    <Section title="The Skeleton of an HTML Page">
                        <p>Here's the absolute minimum code that makes a valid HTML document:</p>

                        <InteractiveCodeBlock language="html" hoverable={true}>
                            {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>`}
                        </InteractiveCodeBlock>

                        <p>Looks simple, right? Let's unpack it line by line.</p>

                        <h3><HighlightTrigger target="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</HighlightTrigger></h3>
                        <p>
                            This magical incantation tells the browser:
                            "Hey, I'm using modern HTML5. Please don't render this like it's 1999."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without it, browsers sometimes fall into quirks mode, where old, inconsistent rules apply. Always include it at the top.
                        </p>

                        <h3><HighlightTrigger target="html">&lt;html&gt;</HighlightTrigger></h3>
                        <p>This is the root element. Everything else goes inside. Think of it as your project's big folder.</p>

                        <h3><HighlightTrigger target="head">&lt;head&gt;</HighlightTrigger></h3>
                        <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is where you put metadata‚Äîstuff about the page, not stuff you see on the page.</p>
                        <p>Inside <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, we usually include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> ‚Üí shows up in the browser tab.</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags ‚Üí describe your page (useful for SEO + social media previews).</li>
                            <li>Links to CSS or JS files.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For now, we'll just stick to <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.</p>

                        <h3><HighlightTrigger target="body">&lt;body&gt;</HighlightTrigger></h3>
                        <p>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is where the visible content lives. Headings, paragraphs, images, buttons‚Äîall go here.</p>
                        <p>Inside our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> we've got:</p>
                        <CodeSnippet language="html">
                            {`<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>This is my first webpage.</p>`}
                        </CodeSnippet>
                    </Section>

                    <Section title="Headings <h1> to <h6>">
                        <p>
                            <Highlight target="headings">&lt;h1&gt;</Highlight> is the biggest, most important heading.
                            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is slightly smaller, and so on until <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Browsers use them to structure the document. Search engines love them, too‚Äîthey help understand what's important.
                        </p>

                            A <Highlight target="paragraph">&lt;p&gt;</Highlight> defines a paragraph.
                            It's block-level (takes the whole width) and is the bread-and-butter for normal text.
