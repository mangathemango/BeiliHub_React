    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What does position: relative; do?",
      "choices": [
        "Removes the element from normal flow",
        "Moves it relative to its normal position",
        "Keeps it fixed on screen",
        "Centers it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Relative offsets the element but keeps its space in the layout."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "When you use position: absolute;, what is the element positioned relative to?",
      "choices": [
        "The nearest ancestor with a positioning context (non-static)",
        "The viewport",
        "The next sibling element",
        "The document root"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Absolute positioning positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or the document if none exists."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which property keeps an element visible while scrolling, but only after reaching a threshold?",
      "choices": [
        "fixed",
        "sticky",
        "absolute",
        "relative"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sticky positioning switches between relative and fixed based on scroll position and defined thresholds."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "position: fixed; is most useful for:",
      "choices": [
        "Elements like floating buttons or headers that must stay visible",
        "Making elements responsive",
        "Aligning inline content",
        "Creating boxes inside boxes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Fixed positioning keeps elements in the same viewport position regardless of scrolling, perfect for persistent UI elements."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Why might position: sticky; not work?",
      "choices": [
        "Its parent container has no scrollable overflow",
        "It's not in the <head> tag",
        "It's missing z-index",
        "It's inside a <footer>"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Sticky positioning requires a scrolling container to function - without scrollable overflow, there's no scroll threshold to trigger the behavior."
